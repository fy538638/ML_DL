# glycerin_RegressionAnalysis
Glycerol, also known as glycerin, is a by-product of biodiesel production. During the transesterification process of vegetable oils or animal fats to produce biodiesel, glycerol is formed as a secondary product. <br><br>
After getting the refined glycerol by purification, it can then be converted to Glycol (including Ethylene Glycol and Propylene Glycol) through chemical conversion under certain conditions -- such as hydrogen, pressure, temperature, pH, etc. <br>
After such conversion, we conduct the chromatographic analysis to measure the areas of Glycerol peak, EG peak, and PG peak, which are used to finally determine the concentrations of remaining Glycerol, EG, and PG by several calculations.<br><br>
Various computations on these concentrations comprise five performance metrics: PG/EG Ratio, Conversion, EG Yield, PG Yield, Overall Glycol Yield. We want the PG/EG Ratio to be as high as possible.
